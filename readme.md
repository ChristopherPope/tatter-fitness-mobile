# TatterFitness Mobile App
This is a Maui mobile app for tracking my workouts. There are many workout apps in the app store, but I wrote this one because I wanted it to be my own and I wanted to do something in mobile development.
I started TF as an Ionic project, re-wrote it as Xamarin, and finally re-wrote it again as a Maui app.

So why is it called TatterFitness? Because my son is the one who started me on working out and we bought him a kitten when he was younger whom he named Tatter.
